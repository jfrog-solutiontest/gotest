version 
1.0.0 - go.mod dependency is Employeev1.1.0 and Pty1.13
1.1.0 - go.mod dependench is Employeev1.2.1 which has a circular dependency with Employeev1.3.0 via Employer mod file. 
	Test Expectation - Processor will create empty project and import this gotestv1.1.0 
	Run go mod graph and go mod graph will resolve Employee Dependency to 1.3.0 since that is the latest and Employeev1.2.1 will be skipped. 
	The go mod graph is stored in this repo as depgraph.txt and is used to validte the CLI to process all the dependency
	This module v1.1.0 will be published and passed. 
	Validation however will fail with panic since it will try to do a go get on v1.2.1 and go will panic because there is v1.3.0.  
	Even with this panic - the validator will pass this module v1.1.0 and promote it to PROD.
